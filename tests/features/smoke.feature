Feature: Docker entrypoint wrapper script works
	The main dab entrypoint is actually a small posix complient shell script
	that wraps docker and starts a container using the dab image for you.

	This script is designed to be lightweight and portable and should rarely be
	updated as the rest of the code for dab lives inside the image.

	Scenario: Can execute dab with no parameters and get usage info
		When I run `dab`

		Then it should fail with "Usage:"

	Scenario: Can execute dab with -h and get usage info
		When I run `dab -h`

		Then it should pass with "Usage:"
